These instructions are meant to be followed in a linux environment and more specifically 
we used Ubuntu 20.04.
The first step is the installation of the tools required for the implementation.
The first installation is of geth for which we run the following commands in the terminal
	$sudo apt install software-properties-common
	$sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
	$sudo apt-get update
	$sudo apt-get install ethereum
Then we will need NodeJS and NPM
We check whether they are already installed in our machine using the following commands
	$node -v  και 
	$npm -v
If they are indeed installed we need to ensure the NodeJS is of version 8 or newer and NPM 
is of version 5 or newer.
If they are not already installed we install them using the following commands
	$sudo apt install nodejs 
	$sudo apt install npm
Finally we install Truffle. For this project we used Truffle version 4.
We run the following command
	$sudo npm install -g truffle@4.0.4
	
After the necessary installations we begin with the node.
In "private" folder we find everything needed for the node. The node assigned for our 
blockchain contains three accounts the hashes of which can be found in "keystore" folder.
Account "0" is the miner. To begin the process we first turn "startnode.sh" to an executable.
To do so we run the following command in "private" directory
	$chmod +x startnode.sh 
and then we run the executable using
	$./startnode.sh
The first time we run it it may take a while, the following times it will be quicker.
While the program is running we open a second terminal and run the following command
	$geth attach
From there we can perform transactions with the accounts we have built. An extensive guide
with the available commands can be found at the following link
	https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console
For the commands that require a password, it is pass 1234 and can also be found in the 
"password.sec" file.
We can exit geth console using typing exit and we can stop the program typing ctrl+c.

We then look into the smart contract application in the node we have built
For starters, in our implementation we have two smart contracts. The first is called 
"migration" and is necessary and it allows us to apply it in different nodes. The other is 
called "Greetings" and it's a simple example we can use to set and print a message.
To apply our smart contracts to the node we have built in the previous step, we open a terminal
in the "Smart Contracts" directory and run the following command
	$truffle migrate --compile-all --reset --network mynet
This command performs the compilation. We then run
	$truffle console --network mynet
to get into the truffle console where we can write commands related to the node and the smart
contracts. Furthermore to run the functions that constitute the "Greetings" smart contract we run 
in the console 
	$Greetings.deployed().then(function(instance){app = instance;})  
After that we can run for example
	$app.getGreetings()
which will show us the smart contract's message, or run
	$app.setGreetings("Hello Friends!", {from: web3.eth.accounts[0]})
which will change the message to "Hello Friends!".

We can always exit the console by typing $.exit
